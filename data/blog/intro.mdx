Hey guys, I'm Steph, and welcome to **Tech Bit-By-Bit**!

If you've ever felt lost in the world of tech, and thought, 'That's a whole other language,' or 'I wouldn't even know where to start,' then you're in the right place.

See, I didn't study Computer Science in college. My journey began with me learning how to build a website for my family’s business with zero coding experience. Fast forward to today: I've completed a coding bootcamp, taken countless courses, earned an Oracle Java certification, and worked in the industry.

Through all of this, I’ve made a lot of mistakes and asked... a _whole LOT_ of questions. And even now, I still ask a whole lot of questions, because I'm always learning. That's why I want to share this journey with you.

I'm not here to give you step-by-step tutorials that you can find everywhere. My goal is to break down complex ideas with relatable stories and metaphors, making it less like a lecture and more like a conversation. I want to help you understand the _why_ because you can generally find the _how_.

So, if you're at the start of your journey, new to the industry, or if you're just curious and want to understand tech without all the jargon, let's explore it together, bit by bit.

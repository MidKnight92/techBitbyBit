Hey, I’m **Stephanie Viveros** (but you can call me Steph!). Welcome to **Tech Bit-by-Bit**!

My goal here is simple: to make tech easy to understand, approachable, and maybe even a little funny. I focus on breaking down confusing tech concepts so they're actually useful—no jargon, just clarity.

My own journey into tech came from a non-traditional background. As I was learning (and let's be honest, I'm _always_ learning!), I found so many tutorials were absolutely packed with dense jargon and confusing buzzwords—it drove me nuts! I firmly believe that learning new technologies doesn’t have to feel like you're trying to decipher a secret code.

That’s exactly why I started **Tech Bit-by-Bit**. I wanted to create a space where technical concepts are explained in plain, simple language, making the whole world of tech feel much less intimidating. Whether we're talking about web development, how databases work, the dynamics of tech teams, or anything in between, I’m here to help you navigate it, one bit at a time.

What can you expect? I focus on creating short, relatable, and real-world content — because learning tech shouldn’t feel like slogging through an outdated textbook. Expect a mix of practical examples and, hopefully, a touch of humor along the way.

When I'm not untangling tech topics or coding, you might find me working alongside my very dedicated, four-legged co-worker, **Gatsby**. He takes his meeting responsibilities very seriously (as long as he’s allowed to nap through most of them). He's the goodest boy and chief morale officer around here!

Thanks for stopping by! I'm excited to share this journey with you. Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/stephanieviveros) or check out my [personal site](https://stephanieviveros.com).

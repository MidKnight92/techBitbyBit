Hi, I’m Gatsby. I’m not just a Boston Terrier—I’m the official nap supervisor, emotional support expert, influencer, and head of snack security at _Tech Bit by Bit_.

When I’m not curled up next to Stephanie while she codes, I enjoy long walks, treats, traveling, and chilling by the lake.

_Yes, I’m named after the character from the book, not the movie. No, I don’t know how to code. Yet._

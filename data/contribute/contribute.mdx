title: 'How to Contribute a Post to Tech Bit-by-Bit'
---

Welcome, fellow tech enthusiasts, to the contribution guide for **Tech Bit-by-Bit**!

I started this blog with a simple goal: to make technology less intimidating by breaking down complex ideas in a plain, simple, and relatable way. If you share that passion and have an idea or a concept you'd love to explain "bit by bit," you're in the perfect place to share your knowledge!

We're always looking for fresh perspectives and simple explanations of tech topics. Whether it's a concept you just grasped, a common problem you solved, or an analogy that helped something click for you – if it makes tech easier to understand, we want to hear about it!

## What We're Looking For

The best **Tech Bit-by-Bit** posts:

- **Make it Simple:** Avoid excessive jargon. Explain complex terms if you must use them.
- **Use Analogies/Stories:** Relate technical ideas to everyday concepts or real-world experiences.
- **Focus on the "Why":** Help readers understand the purpose or benefit, not just the technical steps.
- **Are Approachable:** Maintain a friendly, conversational, and encouraging tone. Humor is welcome!
- **Cover Core Concepts:** Web development, programming basics, data, tools, processes, even just navigating the industry – anything that helps demystify tech.
- **Are Concise:** Aim for clarity over length. Short, focused posts are often more impactful.

## How to Contribute

Contributing is straightforward! Here’s the general process:

1.  **Come Up With an Idea:** Think about a tech concept you can explain simply. You can pitch the idea first (e.g., via a GitHub Issue) or just write the draft.
2.  **Write Your Post:** Draft your explanation following the style points above.
3.  **Format Your Post:** Write your post in **MDX** format. This is Markdown with extra features, but basic Markdown is usually all you need.
4.  **Submit Your Post:** The preferred method is via a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the blog's repository. If you're new to GitHub or PRs, contact Steph (Stephanie Viveros) for alternative submission methods.
5.  **Create and Submit Your Author Page:** Write your Author page and submit it by creating a separate Pull Request (PR) (see example below).

## Writing Your Post in MDX (Markdown Basics)

Your post should be written in **Markdown**, saved with an `.mdx` extension (e.g., `my-awesome-post.mdx`). Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters.

Here’s a quick rundown of common Markdown you'll use:

- **Headings:** Use `#` for headings. The post title in the frontmatter is the main title (`<h1>`), so start your sections with `##` (Heading 2) or `###` (Heading 3).

  ```markdown
  # Post Title (Goes in frontmatter)

  ## Your First Section Heading

  ### A Sub-heading within the section
  ```

- **Paragraphs:** Just write text. Leave a blank line between paragraphs.

  ```markdown
  This is the first paragraph.

  This is the second paragraph.
  ```

- **Emphasis:**
  - _Italics_ or _Italics_
  - **Bold** or **Bold**
  - **_Bold and Italics_** or **_Bold and Italics_**
- **Lists:** Use `*`, `-`, or `+` for unordered lists. Use numbers for ordered lists.

  ```markdown
  - Item one
  - Item two
    - Sub-item A

  1. First step
  2. Second step
  ```

- **Code:** Use backticks `` ` `` for `inline code`. Use triple backticks ` ``` ` for `code blocks`.

  ````markdown
  You can use `console.log()` for debugging.

  ```javascript
  // This is a code block
  function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello, World!')
  }
  ```
  ````

  ```

  ```

- **Links:**
  ```markdown
  Visit the [Tech Bit-by-Bit Homepage](/).
  ```
- **Images:**

  ```markdown
  ![Alt text for the image](/path/to/your/image.jpg)
  ```

  Make sure image files are placed in the `public` folder and use the correct path starting from `/`. For example, `/static/images/your-image.jpg` if placed in `public/static/images/`.

- **Horizontal Rule:** Use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line.
  ```markdown
  ---
  ```

Hi, I’m Gatsby. I’m not just a Boston Terrier—I’m the official nap supervisor, emotional support expert, influencer, and head of snack security at _Tech Bit by Bit_.

When I’m not curled up next to Stephanie while she codes, I enjoy long walks, treats, traveling, and chilling by the lake.

_Yes, I’m named after the character from the book, not the movie. No, I don’t know how to code. Yet._
```

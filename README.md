**Tech Bit-by-Bit** is a content-driven Next.js site designed to break down technology concepts in a friendly, visual, and human-centered way. It’s a safe space for beginners, the tech-curious, and anyone who’s ever felt overwhelmed by jargon.

This project powers a blog, YouTube channel, and podcast aimed at making tech more approachable — one bit at a time.
